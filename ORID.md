## Objective
Today, I learn from the React Lecture and practice about several key concepts in React: `useContext`, Rendering Lifecycle (unmounted, update, didMounted), `props`, and `useEffect`.

## Reflective
Collective 

## Interpretive
Learning these concepts has deepened my understanding of how React manages state and lifecycle, enhancing my ability to build efficient and maintainable applications. The `useContext` hook, in particular, stands out for its ability to streamline state management. The rendering lifecycle knowledge is vital for optimizing component performance, while `props` and `useEffect` are fundamental for creating dynamic and responsive user interfaces.
- **useContext**: **Contextual** - This hook simplifies state management, by giving  a way to share values between components without prop passing componenet by component.
- **Rendering Lifecycle**: **Dynamic** - Understanding the different phases (unmounted, update, didMounted) helps in managing component behavior and optimizing performance.
- **Props**: **Essential** - Props are very important for passing data and functions between components, enabling modular and reusable code.
- **useEffect**: **Reactive** - This hook allows for side effects in functional components, such as data fetching and subscriptions, making components more interactive.

## Decisional
Moving forward, I plan to implement `useContext` in a small project to practice state management without prop drilling.
.Furthermore, Experiment with different lifecycle methods to see their impact on component behavior.  Also, I would use `props` effectively to ensure my components are modular and reusable.
Moreover, I would incorporate `useEffect` for handling side effects, such as fetching data from APIs, to make my applications more interactive.
