## Objective
I connected my frontend React application to my Java Spring Boot project, 
created a concept map summarizing React's lifecycle, hooks, and context, and reviewed the setup of a Spring Boot project.

## Reflective
Supreme


## Interpretive
Connecting React to Spring Boot enhanced my understanding of a FULL-stack development, reminding me the importance of a well-structured backend that support the API calls from the frontend. 
Moreover, the concept map again provided me a clear visual of React's interactions, relationship between knowledge points, and reviewing Spring Boot setup reinforced my backend configuration knowledge.

## Decisional
I am planing to build more full-stack projects to deepen my understanding of frontend and backend integration.
I'll explore advanced React features like custom hooks and context API, 
and continue creating visual aids like concept maps to document and retain complex topics
